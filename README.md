Final Project: Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

Project Description: In this project, students will engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using 
machine learning techniques. They will then upload their respective projects to the course GitHub page. The project is based 
on the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning in R" by Witten, Hastie, James, and Tibshirani. 

The goal is to provide students with the flexibility to select a topic or dataset of their choice for analysis.
